Using HTML CSS and JS I will create a small area RPG game with top down camera view. The game will be single player input but will battle a basic AI. The game will have 3 screens; a start screen for name input, a main game area and a battle screen. In this game players will use various bugs to disable their opponents computer. After each battle the player will gain some amount of xp and increase their computing power. Idea based on Danger Crew and Pokemon.
